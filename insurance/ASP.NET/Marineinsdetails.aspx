      <h3><b >MEANING OF MARINE INSURANCE: &nbsp;</b> </h3>
            <p style="font-size:large;"> 
                A contract of marine insurance is an agreement whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the insured, in the manner and to the 
                extent thereby agreed, against transit losses, that is to say losses incidental to transit. A contract of marine insurance may by
                its express terms or by usage of trade be extended so as to protect the insured against losses on inland waters or any land risk 
                which may be incidental to any sea voyage. </p>

    <h3> <b>  WHY MARINE INSURANCE SHOULD BE DONE?</b> </h3>

  <p style="font-size:large;">Once the goods are mooved out from the warehouse of seller, they are no more in the custody of the seller or the buyer. 
   they are rather in the hands of a third party called the carrier. 
     During the transit loss can arise from:<br />
•	Fire, explosion<br />
•	Contact with water<br />
•	Breakage<br />
•	Accident<br />
•	Theft<br />
•	Non-delivery<br /></p>
        


       <h3> <b>In simple words the marine insurance includes </b><br /></h3>
         <p style="font-size:large;"> A. Cargo insurance: which provides insurance cover in respect of loss of or damage to goods during transit by rail, road, sea or air. <br />
           Thus cargo insurance concerns the following : <br />
       (i)  export and import shipments by ocean-going vessels of all types, <br />
       (ii) coastal shipments by steamers, sailing vessels, mechanized boats, etc.,<br />
       (iii)shipments by inland vessels or country craft, and <br />
       (iv) Consignments by rail, road, or air and articles sent by post. <br />
        
        B. Hull insurance which is concerned with the insurance of ships (hull, machinery, etc.).<br />
         This is a highly technical subject and is not dealt in this module. </p><br />

     <h3>  <b> Claims cover some of the common points covered under marine insurance are:</b></h3>
         <p style="font-size:large;"> 
•	Sinking, stranding, fire, explosion<br />
•	Fire or explosion<br />
•	Loss in loading or unloading cargo<br />
•	Total loss coverage<br />
•	Earthquake or lightning<br />
•	Unforeseeable administrative expenses<br />

          </p>

        <h3><b>Different types of Policies</b></h3>
 <p style="font-size:large;"> 
     These are the types of marine insurance. There are also various types of policies under marine insurance which include the following:<br />
•	<b>Time policy</b> – this policy provides coverage up to a specified time, for instance, one year.<br />
•	<b>Voyage policy </b>– this policy provides coverage for a specific voyage. As soon as the voyage or trip comes to an end, the policy expires<br />
• <b>Mixed policy </b>– this policy combines time policy and voyage policy and covers voyages taken between specific destinations during a specific time period.<br />
•  <b>Mixed policy </b>– this policy combines time policy and voyage policy and covers voyages taken between specific destinations during a specific time period.<br />
•	<b>Port risk policy </b>– this policy covers the loss suffered by the ship when it is anchored at a port<br />
•	<b>Valued policy </b>– under this policy the value of the cargo being transported is mentioned beforehand which specifies the coverage level of the plan. 
        In case of loss of cargo, the value mentioned in the policy is paid as claim<br />
•	<b>Unvalued policy </b>– when the value of the cargo is not determined beforehand, it is called an unvalued policy. Under this policy, the loss suffered 
       would be estimated when the loss happens.<br />
•	 <b>Floating policy</b> – this policy is for businesses which transport goods frequently. Under this policy the policyholder buys the policy for a lump-sum value.
       Nothing else is specified. When the goods are actually transported, a declaration is made for the value of goods which is deducted from the lump sum amount
       selected under the policy. The policy, therefore, covers multiple voyages up to the lump sum limit.<br />
•	<b>Block policy </b>– this policy covers transportation of goods both by land as well as sea<br />
•	<b>Composite policy</b> – this policy is underwritten by multiple underwriters and each underwriter has a fixed liability<br />
•	<b>Fleet policy </b>– this policy is taken by the owner of the vessel to cover the fleet of vessels which he owns.<br />
